# winjob prevent others dev from be scam


I have worked for almost two months and half for this client and I have not get paid. But this not why I have posted these codes.


I have posted this code because I do not want others devs to be scam by this client. 


He uses Internet M as skype ID, but his real skype ID is bdatoz. May be he will changed his skype ID. If you have a doubt just send me pull request I will help you.


And I invite you to make a search on internet with this name, it seems to be linked to a bangladesh user. 


He has promised to use my identity but my name is so special he will not be trust to be an american lol.
